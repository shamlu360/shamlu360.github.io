Files be uploading:
1) 	File Name: "worldmap.json"
	Variable Name: worldmap
	Description: The map to be drawn as base map in the interactive map

2) 	File Name: "whiskymap.json"
	Variable Name: whisky_map
	Description: The map to be drawn on the interactive map to show the whisky-producing countries

3) 	File Name: "whisky_fact.tsv"
	Variable Name: whisky_fact
	Description: The file contains all whisky-producing countries, supplement for interactive map

4) 	File Name: "whisky_clear.csv"
	Variable Name: whisky_data
	Description: The main file contains all whiskies with name, score, countries, characters and else



1st Chunk: Load dataset
	Load dataset from whisky_fact and whisky_data

2nd Chunk: Interactive map
	- Interactive map draw on div#map, include #basemap

	In div#map, use #basemap draw world map in gray on the next layer.
	On top of #basemap layer, draw whisky-producing countries map with id with the same as the country id from buttons in html codes below:

	Buttons from html codes: 
	class = "country"
	id = First 3 letters of the countries in lower case, except United Kingdom and USA
	Note:
	id of United Kingdom is 'uk' and United States is 'usa'

	var map -> Variable call to draw interactive map
	var summ -> Variable call to display texts when there is interaction from map or buttons

	When user mouseover on the country on Interactive map, d3 would obtain the id of that country,
	d3 would use the id to obtain the facts from whisky_fact, display on div#summary, and fill the country in red. The text will disappear and country fill back to teal once mouseout.

	Alternatively, if user click on one of the buttons in div#country_name, d3 would obtain the id of that country, d3 would use the id to obtain the facts from whisky_fact, display on div#summary, and fill the country in red. The text will disappear and country fill back to teal when another button be clicked or mouseover on the country in the next time.

3rd Chunk: Bar Chart
	- Bar Chart on div#barchart
	- Use whisky_data and compute the average score on each country and show on bar chart
	- Add a line on the line chart on world average score

4th Chunk:
	- Bubble Chart for 4 types of whisky of our data base
	- 4 types of bubble charts to display based on user’s choice from #type_dropdown
	- User first choose from #type_dropdown
	- svg#bubble update once user’s choice is made

5th Chunk:
	Using <div> with id="dropdown" and "suggestion"

	For id="dropdown" is the dropdown list for user to choose a country

	For id="suggestion", after the user have choose a country and a character, the
	code will generate a table of list of suggested whisky based on country and
	character chose by user. The default country is "Scotland". When user choose a
	character without clicking country, the code will generate the result based on
	Scotland and the corresponding character.

	var col -> table header

	var tabulate -> Function to generate a table from a filtered dataset and table columns
		-Header: Allow user to sort the table when clicking on header
		-Rows: Includes cells
		-Cells:
			Recodes "costs" from integers 1-6 to "$","$$","$$$","$$$$","$$$$$","$$$$$+", respectively
			Rdcodes "clusters" from A-J, R0-R4 to following:
				"A" = "Fruity, Honey, Spicy"
              	"B" = "Fruity, Floral, Malty"
              	"C" = "Fruity, Floral, Nutty"
              	"E" = "Fruity, Honey, Malty, Winey"
              	"F" = "Fruity, Spicy, Smoky"
              	"G" = "Honey, Floral, Fruity, Spicy"
              	"H" = "Fruity, Malty, Floral"
              	"I" = "Fruity, Nutty, Spicy, Smoky"
              	"J" = "Fruity, Spicy, malty, Very Smoky"
              	"R0" = "No rye grain"
              	"R1" = "Low rye"
              	"R2" = "Standard rye"
              	"R3" = "High rye"
              	"R4" = "Straight rye"

    var filteredList -> function to filter the dataset based on user's selection on country, character, and price range

    On div#dropdown, create a drop down list for countries for user to select. Default country is "Scotland"

    No default selected character.

    When user click on "USA", div#rye_contain pop out for user to select for rye whisky. It does not pop when other country is selected.

    Once a character is picked on #character_button (Even user did not select any country in drop down list), it will call tabulate and generate a table. After that div#money pop out for user to filter price range. Price range is optional but it will call tabulate again to regenerate the table.
